    classes
    fields
    methods
    comments
class example:
    public class Animal {
    }
public - type of the class means that the class can be used by other classes
Animal -  the name of the class

public class Animal {
String name;
}

String name = define a variable called name
STRING = a value that we can put text into

    public class Animal {
        String name;
    public String genName() {
        return name;
     }
     public void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
     }
    }
// public String genName() { ---- define the method
        return name; --return type , the method returns a string
     }
     method = operation that can be called
//     public void setName(String newName) {
          name = newName; -> the second method, but this method returns a VOID
          void = no value is returned. requires a parameter
          setName = newName > parameter
public int numberVisitors (int month)
INT-> defines a numeric type

CLASSES vs Files

class Animal {
    String name;
}

-> 2 classes in the file
public class Animal {
    private String name;
    }
class Animal2 {
}

JAVA JDK
To compile Java code, the file must have the extension .java or javax
The name of the file must match the name of the class. The result is a file of bytecode by the same name, but with
a .class filename extension.
Bytecode = instructions that the JVM knows how to execute. Notice that we must omit the .class extension to run Zoo.java
    because the period has a reserved meaning in the JVM.

The rules for what a Java code file contains, and in what order
Each file can contain only one class.
The filename must match the class name, including case, and have a .java extension.

main() Method - access modifier
void =  represents the return type
-> declare the entry point
put in a main() method
public class Zoo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}

public class Zoo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
        System.out.println(args[1]);
    }
}
args[0] - access the first element of the array.
    array indexes begin with 0 in java

Package declarations and imports
classes group in packages
public class ImportExample {
    public static void main(String[]args) {
        Random r = newRandom(); // - DOES NOT COMPILE
        System.out.println(R.NextInt(10));
    }
}

import java.util.Random; //import tells us where to find Randon
public class ImportExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Randon r = new Random();
        System.out.println(r.nextInt(10)); //print a number betwen 0 & 9 . Java starts counting from 0
    }
}

WILDCARDS
* = wildcard every class in the java.util package is available. it imports only classes, not methods orr child packages
classes in the same packages are imported together
import java.util.*; //imports java.util.Random
public class ImportExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rand r = new Random();
        System.out.println(r.nextInt(10));
    }
}

Reduntant Imports
java.lang - is automatically imported
java.nio.file -contains both files & paths

Naming conflicts
Java provides java.util.Date & java.sql.Date

import to use java.util.Date version:

public cass Conflicts {
    Date date;
    //some more code
}

import java.util.*;
import java.sql.*; //DOES NOT COMPILE

creating a new package:
c:\temp.packagea\ClassA.java

package packagea;
public class classA {

}

C:\temp\packageb\ClassB.java

package packageb;
import packagea.ClassA
public class classB {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassA a;
        Ststem.out.println("Got it!");
    }
}


CREATING OBJECTS
1.CONSTRUCTORS
declare the type you'll be creating, and give the variable a name
Random() = method because it's followed by() -> CONSTRUCTOR
Randon r = new Random();
public class Chick {
    public Chick() {
        Syste.out.println("in construction");
    }
}

! When you see a method name beginning with a capital letter and having a return type, pay special attention to it.
It is not a constructor since there’s a return type. It’s a regular method that won’t be called when you write new Chick()!

public class Chicken {
    int numEggs = 0; //initialize on line
    String name;
    public Chicken() {
        name = "Duke"; //initialize in constructor
    }
}

Reading & writing object fields
write instance variables directly from the caller
public class Swan {
    int numberEggs;//instance variable
    public static voidmain(String[] args) {
        Swan mother =new Swan();
        mother.numberEggs =1; //set variable
        System.out.println(mother.numberEggs); // read variable
    }
}

public class Name {
    String first = "Theodore";
    String last = "Moose";
    String full = first + last;

}

code betwen ({} )-> code block


Order of initializations
1.Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear in the file.
2.The constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks have run.

public class Chick {
    private String name = "Fluffy";
    { System.out.println("setting field"); }
    public Chick() {
        name = "Tiny";
        System.out.println ("setting constructor");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Chick chick - new Chick();
        System.out.println(chick.name);}
    }

 Reference type
 references doesn't hold the value of the object they refer to

 Key differences
 reference types can have "null" - they don't currently refer to an object
 int value = null; //does not compile
 String s = null ; //compiles
 String reference = "hello";
 int leg = reference.length();
 int bad = len.length(); //does not compile
 class starts with uppercase(L, X,V)
 primitive starts with lowercase (l,x,m,n)


 DECLARING & INITIALIZING VARIABLES
 VARIABLE = piece of memory that stores data
When you declare a variable:
    > state the variable type
    > give a name
ex: the next lines declare 2 diff variables:
String zooName;
int numberAnimals;
    > initialize a variable = giving a value to it:
zooName = "The Best Zoo";
numberAnimals = 100;

DECLARING & INITIALIZING:
String zooName = "The Best Zoo";
int numberAnimals = 100;

Declaring multiple variables in the same statement:
String s1, s2;
String s3 = "yes" , s4 = "no";
int i1, i2, i3 = 3;

PAY ATTENTION:
int num, String value; // DOES NOT COMPILE
double d1, double d2; // DOES NOT COMPILE - 2 DIFFERENT TYPES IN SAME STATEMENT
int i3; i4; // DOES NOT COMPILE - 2 DIFFERENT TYPES IN SAME STATEMENT

IDENTIFIERS
3 RULES FOR LEGAL IDENTIFIERS:
    > the NAME must begin with a letter or the symbol $ or _
    > subsequent characters may also be numbers
    > you cannot use as name a JAVA RESERVED WORD

These examples are not legal:
3DPointClass // identifiers cannot begin with a number
hollywood@vine // @ is not a letter, digit, $ or _
*$coffee // * is not a letter, digit, $ or _
public // public is a reserved word


Most Java developers follow these conventions for identifier names:
> Method and variables names begin with a lowercase letter followed by CamelCase.
> Class names begin with an uppercase letter followed by CamelCase. Don’t start any
    identifiers with $. The compiler uses this symbol for some files.

1. LOCAL VARIABLES:
-> defined within a method
> must be initialized before use

ex
public int notValid() {
    int x = 10;
    int y;
    int z = x + y; //DOES NOT COMPILE int y does not have a value assigned
    return z;
}

public int Valid() {
    int x = 10;
    int y; //y is declared here
    y = 3; //and initialized here
    int z = x + y;
    return z;
}

public void findAnswer(bolean check) {
    int answer;
    int onlyOneBranch;
    if (check) {
        onlyOneBranch = 1;
        answer = 1;
    }
    else {
        answer = 2;
    }
    System.out.println(answer);
    System.out.println(onlyOneBranch); // does not compile
 }

 INSTANCE & CLASS VARIABLES
 instance or class variables = variables that are not local variables
 instance variables are called FIELDS
 -> class variable WHEN has STATIC keyword in its declaration
 -> when you declare them, they receive a default value (null for an object and 0/false for a primitive)
 Local variables—in scope from declaration to end of block
 Instance variables—in scope from declaration until object garbage collected
 Class variables—in scope from declaration until program ends

 PROPERTIES:
 TYPE
 NAME
 VALUE

VARIABLES:
DECLARE A VARIABLE:
int a;
String s;
double c; ///used for fractional or real numbers

add value / initializing:
int i = 3;
int a = 1;
int b = a + 1;

visibility of variables:
1. A variable declared in a method exists (is visible) from the start of its declaration to the end of the method.

2. A variable declared in a code block exists until the end of the code block.

3. A method's parameters exist everywhere within the method.

4. Variables in an object exist during the entire lifespan of the object that contains them.
    Their visibility is also defined by special access modifiers: public and private.

5. Static (class) variables exist the whole time the program is running. Their visibility is also defined by access modifiers.
