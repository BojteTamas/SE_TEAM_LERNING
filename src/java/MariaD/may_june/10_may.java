/*
The while statement
uses nonconstant variables
each repetition of the statement may be different
ex:
    int roomInBelly = 5;
    public void eatCheese (int bitesOfCheese) {
        while (bitesOfCheese > 0 && roomInBelly > 0) {
            bitesOfCheese--;
            roomInBelly--;
        }
        System.out.println(bitesOfCheese+"pieces of cheese left");
    }

    INFINITE LOOPS

    DO-WHILE STATEMENT
    The primary difference : do-while loop purposely orders the statement or block of statements
                                before the conditional expression - to reinforce that
                                the statement will be executed before the expression is ever evaluated

                                ex:
                                int x = 0;
                                do {
                                    x++;
                                 }
                              while(false);
                              System.out.println(x);


     FOR STATEMENT
     FOR LOOP
     EX:
     for (int i= 0; i < 10; i++) {
     System.out.println(i + "");
     }

     int x = 1;
     long y = 10;
     for (y = 0, x=4, x<5 && y<10; x++, y++) {
     System.out.println(x + " ");
     }


     for each statement
