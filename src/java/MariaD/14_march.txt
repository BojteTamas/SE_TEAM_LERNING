definition of a program: "A program is a set (list) of commands. First, you execute the first command,
then the second, then the third and so on. Once all the commands are executed, the program is finished"
The JVM is a special program that knows how to execute programs written in Java
In the Java programming language, each command is written on its own line. A semicolon must be placed at the end of a command.
