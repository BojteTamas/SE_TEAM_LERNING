Raluca G: Exceptions OCA Chapter:
hierarchy splits into two branches: Error and Exception.
Am gasit o info care nu ma lamureste complet:
Errors are usually beyond the control of the programmer, and we should not try to handle errors.
the differences between Error and Exception that is as follows:
Error: An Error indicates a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
Exception: Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.

Ce faci in cazul in care ai o eroare de genul? Iti da crash total--> how do you solve it?Cum mergi mai departe?
Sau ma gandesc eu prea departe la conceptul de eroare?
