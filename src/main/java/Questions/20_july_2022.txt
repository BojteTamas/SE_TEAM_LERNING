question 16, questions from Ch6
16. Which scenario is the best use of an exception? // I do not understand the question and the answer
A. An element is not found when searching a list. // ?? not an exception because it usualy returns null or -1?
B. An unexpected parameter is passed into a method. // IllegalArgumentException
C. The computer caught fire. // no way to think of this one
D. You want to loop through a list. // you use for, not throwing an exception?
E. You donâ€™t know how to code a method. // :)) funny if not sad :))

Answer:
B. IllegalArgumentException is used when an unexpected parameter is passed into a method.
Option A is incorrect because returning null or -1 is a common return value for this scenario.
Option D is incorrect because a for loop is typically used for this scenario.
Option E is incorrect because you should find out how to code the method and not leave it
  for the unsuspecting programmer who calls your method.
Option C is incorrect because you should run!
