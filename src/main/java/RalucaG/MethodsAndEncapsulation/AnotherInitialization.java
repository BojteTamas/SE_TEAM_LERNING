/**
 * Instance Initialization Blocks : used to initialize instance variables, executed before
 * constructors. They run each time when an object of the class is created.
 *
 * <p>Initializer block : the code that is always executed whenever an instance is created. It is
 * used to declare/initialize the common part of various constructors of a class.
 *
 * <p>Constructors : are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state. Like methods, a constructor also
 * contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object
 * creation.
