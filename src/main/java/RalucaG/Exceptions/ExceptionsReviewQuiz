Q15:A,B,D,E --> IOException is checked except -> correct;
Q16:B ; A not really, because if not found can return null or not found something;/ C doesn;t have anything to do, D as well, you can loop through a list without having to use an exception; not knowing to code a method doesn't mean you need to use exceptions to show you can't code:)))-->correct;
