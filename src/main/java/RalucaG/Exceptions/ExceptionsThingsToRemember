**Types of exceptions:
user-defined and built-in exception;
Built-in exceptions:
    checked exception ->verified at compile time by the compiler;
        ClassNotFoundException
        InterruptedException
        IOException
        InstantiationException
        SQLException
        FileNotFoundException
    unchecked exception -> not verified by compiler, no compilation error;
        ArithmeticException
        ClassCastException
        NullPointerException
        ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        ArrayStoreException
        IllegalThreadStateException
 User-Defined exceptions:user creats exceptions to describe a certain situation;
    Provision to Complete Program Execution
    Easy Identification of Program Code and Error-Handling Code
    Propagation of Errors
    Meaningful Error Reporting
    Identifying Error Types

To Remember:
A try block can be followed by one or more catch blocks. Each catch block must contain a different exception handler.
At a time only one exception occurs and at a time only one catch block is executed.
All catch blocks must be ordered from most specific to most general, i.e. catch for ArithmeticException must come before catch for Exception.

/***
The reason that itâ€™s okay to declare new runtime exceptions in a subclass method is that
the declaration is redundant. Methods are free to throw any runtime exceptions they want
without mentioning them in the method declaration
