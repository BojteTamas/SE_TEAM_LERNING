when creating a new class you can define the class to inherit from an existing class
Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming)
inheriting = extends
the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class
       the process by witch the new child subclass automatically includes
    any public/ protected primitives, objects or methods defined in parent class
java supports single inheritance
java allows only one public class/ file

super/parent/base class: class whose features are inherited
sub/derived/child class : the class that inherits the other class
                            can add its own fields and metthods in addition to super class
reusability = when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes a piece of code that we want
            we can derive our new class from the existing class
            => in this case, we reuse the fields, and methods of the existing class
