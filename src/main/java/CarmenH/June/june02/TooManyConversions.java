/*
   Here we have a problem. Java is happy to convert the int 4 to a long 4 or an Integer 4.
   It cannot handle converting in two steps to a long and then to a Long.
   If we had public static void play(Object o) { }, it would match because only one conversion would be necessary:
   from int to Integer. An Integer is an Object, as youâ€™ll see in Chapter 5.
