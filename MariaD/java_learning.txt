Starting learning Java on codegym.cc
LEVEL 1
definition of a program: "A program is a set (list) of commands. First, you execute the first command,
then the second, then the third and so on. Once all the commands are executed, the program is finished"
The JVM is a special program that knows how to execute programs written in Java
In the Java programming language, each command is written on its own line. A semicolon must be placed at the end of a command.
declaring variables : integer, string, double
system.out.print - displays the output on the same line in console
system.out.println - displays the output on different lines
1 class can contain multiple methods
2 variables with the same name can only be defined in different methods, never in the same method
->progress until Lesson3

Ellie, variables, and data types
definition of a variable: Variables are special entities used to store data
characteristics:  has three important properties: type, name, and value.
To create (or declare) a variable, we use the name of the type: TypeName variableName.
Remember that Java is case-sensitive. int a is not the same as Int a

the jvm will compile the bytecode into machine code before the program is executed
1) Enterprise: heavy server-oriented applications for banks, corporations, investment funds, etc.

2) Mobile: mobile development (smartphones, tablets), thanks to Android.

3) Web: PHP is in the lead, but Java has captured a solid share of the market.

4) Big Data: distributed computing in clusters consisting of thousands of servers.

5) Smart devices: programs for smart homes, electronic devices, IoT refrigerators, etc.

how to comment:
The beginning of the comment is indicated by a pair of symbols (/*), and the end â€“ by (*/).
When the program is compiled, the compiler omits everything between the symbols /* and */
the code starting with the // and up to the end of the line with the // is considered to be a comment

recap & exercises
> leson 1: simple command:
System.out.println("Robots are friends to humans");
> variables / methods "functions"
public class Home

System.out.println(1); ---- displays the number 1 on the screen
ex: */
It's cool to be a programmer!
*/
package en.codegym.task.jdk13.task01.task0101;

/*
It's cool to be a programmer!
*/

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.print("I think being a programmer is cool");
    }
}

> VARIABLES:
Variables are special entities used to store data
every variable has three important properties: type, name, and value
declaring a variable:
int a;
string s; --
double c; -- fractional or real numbers
a = 1; ---Assign the value 1 to variable a.
b = a+1; --- Assign the value 2 to variable b.
/
x = 3; --Assign the value 3 to variable x.
x = x + 1; --In the next line, the value of x increases by 1, making x equal to 4.

--when you add strings and numbers, the result is always a string
ex 1
package en.codegym.task.jdk13.task01.task0102;

/*
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "Ellie is very smart";
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);

    }
}
*/
ex2
/*
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 3126;
        int b = a - 8;
        System.out.println(b);
    }
}

Things I learned about:
Variables
Displaying text on the screen
int and String types
The difference between compiling in Java and other languages
Adding comments in code and why we need them
quiz passed

LEVEL 2
Memory addressing and variables
Def: > When a variable is declared in code, a bit of memory that isn't already being used is assigned to it.
    > a unique name is assigned to each variable

ex 1:
package en.codegym.task.jdk13.task01.task0109;

/*
We solemnly publish and declare these variables...
*/

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 2;
        int b = 3;
    }
}

ex 2:

/*
One variable is not enough
*/

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 3;
        int b = 5;
        String s = "Maria";
    }
}

ex 3
/*
Display the square of a number
*/

public class Solution {
    public static int number = 25;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int a = number * number;
       System.out.println(a);
    }
}

Lesson 4:
2 major types in Java : String and int
We store strings/text in String, and integers (whole numbers) in int.
"=" > assignment operator
merge strings with the + sign:
" " > define space
A variable's value can be used to compute a new value that will replace the old one
ex:
package en.codegym.task.jdk13.task01.task0139;

/*
Kiss my shiny metal rear actuator
*/

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       String s = "Kiss my shiny metal rear actuator!";
       System.out.println(s);
    }
}
